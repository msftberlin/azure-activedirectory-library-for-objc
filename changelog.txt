Version 2.2.5 (09.09.2016)
-------------
* Fixed an issue where NTLM authentication did not show if the authentication prompt came after the first redirect.
* Switched to a single framework/library build that can be included in both applications and extensions

Version 2.2.4 (08.23.2016)
-------------
* Fixed an issue caused with some redirects where the webview would not update the base URL properly.


Version 2.2.3 (08.22.2016)
-------------
* Fixed an issue where federated endpoints redirecting to URLs that would trigger URL canonicalization would cause ADAL to go to that endpoint twice. This was causing some non-ADFS federated endpoints to fail.
* (Mac Only) Fixed thread safety issues in -[ADTokenCache serialize] (#710)
* Allow redirect URIs that start with "http://". however we still will not traverse those pages but we will get the authorization code from the URL. (#720)
* Separate out the library build targets so applications including ADAL's project file as a subproject can pull in either the Framework cleanly. However using both the framework and static library can still cause issues. This is an unavoidable side effect of the header search order in Xcode. (#693)
* Created a separate framework build target for iOS extension-safe ADAL.
* Properly set the minimum supported SDK version for ADAL framework to iOS 8.0 (#694)
* Added a Swift Sample App (#97)


Version 2.2.2 (07.18.2016)
-------------
* Fixed a newly-uncovered issue where ADAL could not get the application's code signing Team ID while the device is locked. (#698)

Version 2.2.1 (06.30.2015)
-------------
* Added support for iOS 9's -application:openURL:options: method (#662)
* Fixed a bug that caused the NTLM dialog to not appear (#666)
* Properly handle keychain errors that happen while retrieving Workplace Join information (#685)
* Added support for ADAL to use Keychain access groups in the Simulator when available (#670)
* Fixed the include path when consuming ADAL as a static library (#630)
* Error codes will appear as strings (ie. "AD_ERROR_SERVER_USER_INPUT_REQUIRED") in error messages now.
* Limited support for App Extensions. ADAL now has an app extension safe build in both the Xcode project (iOS static lib only) and CocoaPod. Interactive Auth is not supported in extensions as well. (#560)
* Fixed a bug that caused ADAL to erroneously unpercent encode query parameters being passed on. (#689)


Version 2.2.0 (05.16.2016)
-------------
* Added support for Family of Client IDs among Microsoft apps
* (iOS Only) Added +[ADKeychainTokenCache defaultKeychainCache] and +[ADKeychainTokenCache keychainCacheForGroup:] APIs to make how to use the keychain token cache APIs more discoverable.
* Fixed a crash on first use of the broker when creating a broker key
* Added extensibility properties to token cache items to allow for forwards compatibility in the future.
* Set the 'Skip Install' setting to 'YES' on all framework and static library targets.
